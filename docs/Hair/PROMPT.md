### Summary Article Prompt

Consider thoroughly and then carefully put together an article that summarizes
the current best-practices and state-of-the-art for cloth simulation in game
engines. Especially techniques that leverage the GPU.

While being complete and thorough, describe using easy-to-understand writing
that promotes both intuition and complete understanding. The language should be
accessible and generally engaging, drawing interesting connections with the
real-world.

For the target student, this is a new topic, but student understands real-time
rendering pipelines including using compute shaders for physics. Drawing
analogies and other connections to related rendering concepts is helpful and can
provide additional engagement.

Code should be use wgsl and rust, where needed. Code provided should be fully
complete, without missing sections or placeholders.

### Lecture Notes Prompt

Please consider the paper in depth. Act as a lecturer or tutor who wishes to
provide an understanding of the key concepts in this paper, with enough detail
to allow for reproduction of the techniques described.

Please create an easy to understand thorough lecture notes that leads to a
complete understanding of this document. The language should be accessible and
generally engaging, drawing interesting connections with the real-world.

For the student, cloth simulation is a new topic, but student has knowledge of
WGPU, WGSL, Rust, Real-time rendering pipelines, including compute shaders.
Drawing analogies and references to other rendering concepts is helpful and can
provide additional engagement.

Please provide code examples in rust, using wgpu and wgsl. And make sure to
include complete code examples. Ensure thorough coverage of the following new
concepts:

- DER
- MPM
- LDL decomposition
- Hybrid method described in paper
