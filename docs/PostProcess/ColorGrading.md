## Tone Mapping and Color Grading Summary for Game Engine and Real-Time Renderer in Rust, WGPU, WGSL, with extensive shader usage, vertex, fragment and compute shaders.

46. **Narrative-Driven Color Grading**

    - **Dynamic LUTs**: Shifts palette based on story beats (e.g., _Breaking
      Bad_â€™s stark tones).

47. **Color Grading** Adjusts image colors using lookup tables (LUTs) or curves
    to achieve a specific mood or aesthetic.
48. **Color Correction/Grading:**

    - **Description:** Adjusting the overall color balance, saturation,
      contrast, and tone mapping of the rendered image. This is fundamental for
      establishing mood and visual style.
    - **Techniques:** Look-up tables (LUTs), color matrix adjustments, curves,
      brightness/contrast controls.
    - **Commonality:** Extremely common, essential for nearly every real-time
      application.
    - **Visual Impact:** Profound; shapes the entire visual mood and aesthetic.

49. **Color Grading**

    - Adjusts color palettes for mood/artistic intent (e.g., LUTs, curves).

50. **Color Grading** Adjusts color/contrast via LUTs (Look-Up Tables) for
    mood/atmosphere.
51. **Tone Mapping** Maps high dynamic range (HDR) brightness levels to a
    displayable range, preserving detail in bright and dark areas.
52. **Color Grading** Adjusts image colors using lookup tables (LUTs) or curves
    to achieve a specific mood or aesthetic.

    - Standard for realistic color grading.
    - LUT (Lookup Table) Color Grading [Very Common]
    - Applies film-like color effects.

53. **Tone Mapping**

    - **Description:** Maps high dynamic range (HDR) brightness levels to a
      displayable range, preserving detail in bright and dark areas.
    - **Techniques:**
      - **ACES Filmic Tone Mapping:** Standard for realistic color grading.
      - **Various operator methods:** Reinhard, Hable, etc.
    - **Commonality:** Very common, essential for HDR rendering pipelines.
    - **Visual Impact:** Significantly improves the dynamic range of scenes.

54. **Color Grading/Correction**

    - **Description:** Adjusts image colors using lookup tables (LUTs) or curves
      to achieve a specific mood or aesthetic.
    - **Techniques:**
      - **LUT (Look-Up Table) Color Grading:** Applies film-like color effects.
      - **Color matrix adjustments:** Modifies color balance and relationships.
      - **Curves adjustment:** Fine control over specific tonal ranges.
    - **Commonality:** Extremely common, essential for nearly every real-time
      application.
    - **Visual Impact:** Profound; shapes the entire visual mood and aesthetic.
    - **Advanced use:** Narrative-Driven Color Grading with Dynamic LUTs that
      shift palette based on story beats (e.g., _Breaking Bad_'s stark tones).
