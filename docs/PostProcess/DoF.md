2. **Depth of Field** Simulates camera lens focus, blurring objects outside a
   specific depth range to emphasize certain parts of the scene.
3. **Depth of Field (DoF)** Blurs foreground/background to mimic camera focus.

4. **Depth of Field** Simulates camera lens focus, blurring objects outside a
   specific depth range to emphasize certain parts of the scene.
5. **Depth of Field (DoF):**

   - **Description:** Simulating the selective focus of a camera lens, blurring
     distant or close objects to draw attention to a specific focal point.
   - **Techniques:** Bokeh simulation, Gaussian blur based on depth,
     gather/scatter techniques.
   - **Commonality:** Common, used to create a cinematic look and emphasize
     specific elements.
   - **Visual Impact:** Adds realism and cinematic depth, directs the viewer's
     focus.

6. Depth of Field (DoF)

Simulates camera focus blur, enhancing cinematic visuals. • Gaussian Blur DoF
[Common] • Fast but lacks realistic bokeh. • Bokeh DoF [Moderate Use] •
Physically accurate DoF with hexagonal/circular aperture shapes. • More
expensive but creates film-like visuals. • Hybrid Ray-Traced DoF
[State-of-the-Art] • Uses real lens simulation for realistic blur with chromatic
aberrations.

   - Simulates camera focus by blurring near/far objects (e.g., bokeh, Gaussian
     blur).
