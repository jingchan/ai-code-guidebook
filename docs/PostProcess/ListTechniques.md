     light interactions.
   - **Hybrid Rendering**: Combines rasterization with ray-traced elements
     (e.g., shadows, AO).

2. **AI/ML-Driven Methods**

   - **DLSS/FSR/XeSS**: Upscaling via neural networks for higher performance and
     resolution.
   - **NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields)**: AI-reconstructed 3D scenes from 2D
     images.

3. **Path Tracing Denoising**

   - Real-time denoisers (e.g., SVGF, OptiX) to clean up noisy path-traced
     frames.

4. **Global Illumination (GI)**

   - **Lumen (UE5)**: Real-time GI using software-based ray tracing.
   - **VXGI (Voxel GI)**: Approximates indirect light via voxel grids.

5. **Temporal Super Resolution**

   - Combines temporal data with upscaling (e.g., TSR in UE5).

6. **Foveated Rendering**

   - Reduces peripheral resolution using eye-tracking (common in VR).

7. **Virtualized Geometry**

   - **Nanite (UE5)**: Renders micro-detail without LOD systems.

8. **Photon-Based Post-Processing**
   - Simulates light transport effects (e.g., caustics) in deferred pipelines.

### **Artisanal/Bespoke Techniques**

1. **Stylized Rendering**

   - **Cel Shading**: Comic-book aesthetics with bold outlines.
   - **Watercolor/Painterly Effects**: Simulates brush strokes or ink bleeds.

2. **Retro Filters**

   - **CRT Scanlines/Pixelation**: Emulates old monitors or low-res games.
   - **VHS Effects**: Adds tape distortion, tracking errors, and noise.

3. **Dynamic Environmental Effects**

   - **Rain/Oil on Lens**: Interactive droplets or smudges.
   - **Heat Haze**: Distorts air above hot surfaces.

4. **Custom Depth-Based Effects**

   - **Tilt-Shift**: Miniaturizes scenes with selective blur.
   - **Edge Glow**: Highlights silhouettes based on depth.

5. **Non-Photorealistic Effects**

   - **Crosshatching/Stippling**: Sketch-like shading.
   - **Anamorphic Flares**: Stretched lens streaks (e.g., _Star Trek_).

6. **Glitch Art**

   - **Data Moshing**: Intentional compression artifacts.
   - **RGB Split**: Channel displacement for digital distortion.

7. **Procedural Overlays**

   - **Hex Grids/Scanlines**: Adds sci-fi or UI elements.
   - **Dynamic Palette Swapping**: Shifts colors based on gameplay.

8. **Morphological Effects**
   - **Erosion/Dilation**: Pixel manipulation for stylized edges.

### **Pipeline Considerations**

- **Order Matters**: Tone mapping after HDR, AA before sharpening.
- **Hybrid Workflows**: Combining deferred/forward rendering for specific
  effects.
- **VR-Specific**: Lens distortion correction, fixed foveated rendering.

This list spans foundational methods, modern innovations, and niche artistic
tools, reflecting the breadth of post-processing in games, films, and
interactive media.
