28. **Motion Blur** Simulates movement by blurring objects in motion.
29. **Motion Blur** Adds blur to fast-moving objects, enhancing the perception
    of speed and dynamism.

30. **Motion Blur** Adds blur to fast-moving objects, enhancing the perception
    of speed and dynamism.
31. **Motion Blur:**

    - **Description:** Simulating the blur caused by fast-moving objects or
      camera movement.
    - **Techniques:** Accumulating previous frames, velocity buffers, temporal
      reprojection.
    - **Commonality:** Common, used to enhance the sense of speed and fluidity.
    - **Visual Impact:** Adds realism to motion, creates a dynamic feel.

32. Motion Blur

Creates the illusion of speed and smooths low-frame-rate gameplay. •
Screen-Space Motion Blur [Common] • Simple velocity buffer-based blur applied
per-pixel. • Per-Object Motion Blur [Less Common] • More accurate blur based on
object movement rather than screen-space approximations. • Neural Motion Blur
[Cutting-Edge] • AI-based motion blur for physically accurate streaks. 3.
