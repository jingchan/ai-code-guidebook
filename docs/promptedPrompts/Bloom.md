Below is a comprehensive guide to developing a state-of-the-art bloom rendering
pipeline using Rust and WGSL, designed to achieve a visually stunning,
artistically driven aesthetic that captures the nuanced, ethereal qualities of
natural luminescence. This pipeline balances visual quality, performance, and
flexibility, meeting the specified requirements and considerations.

## Technique Exploration

To create a bloom effect that transcends typical implementations, we first
compare contemporary bloom techniques, assessing their strengths and weaknesses
in terms of visual quality, performance, and artistic control.

### 1. Gaussian Blur

- **Description**: A traditional method that applies a Gaussian kernel to blur
  bright image areas, simulating light bleed.
- **Visual Quality**: Produces a soft, natural glow but may introduce halo
  artifacts around high-contrast edges if not carefully tuned.
- **Performance**: Computationally expensive for large blur radii due to many
  texture samples; separable filters (splitting into horizontal and vertical
  passes) can optimize this.
- **Artistic Control**: Offers basic parameterization (radius, intensity) but
  lacks advanced directional or spectral options.

### 2. Dual Kawase Blur

- **Description**: An optimized blur using iterative downsampling and upsampling
  with a specific kernel, designed for performance.
- **Visual Quality**: Achieves smooth results similar to Gaussian blur with
  fewer artifacts than naive methods, though it may struggle with extreme
  contrast.
- **Performance**: More efficient than Gaussian blur, especially for large
  radii, due to reduced sampling; ideal for lower-end hardware.
- **Artistic Control**: Similar to Gaussian blur, with adjustable intensity and
  radius, but limited in directional effects.

### 3. Multi-Scale Downsampling and Upsampling (Pyramidal Approach)

- **Description**: Creates a mipmap pyramid of downsampled images, blurred and
  upsampled progressively to build the bloom.
- **Visual Quality**: Efficient for large blurs but may lose high-frequency
  details, resulting in a less precise effect unless paired with quality
  kernels.
- **Performance**: Logarithmic cost scaling with blur radius makes it highly
  efficient for expansive glows.
- **Artistic Control**: Flexible with different kernels (e.g., Gaussian, box)
  and blending options during upsampling.

### 4. Compute Shader-Based Tile Bloom

- **Description**: Processes the image in tiles using compute shaders,
  leveraging GPU parallelism.
- **Visual Quality**: Comparable to fragment-based methods, with potential for
  high fidelity if tuned to avoid tiling artifacts.
- **Performance**: Excels at high resolutions due to efficient memory access and
  parallelism; ideal for modern GPUs.
- **Artistic Control**: Offers standard blur parameters, with added complexity
  in implementation limiting rapid experimentation.

### 5. Anisotropic Bloom

- **Description**: Applies directional blur to simulate effects like lens flares
  or light streaks.
- **Visual Quality**: Adds dynamic, artistic flair, enhancing realism for
  specific light sources (e.g., headlights, sun rays).
- **Performance**: More complex than isotropic blurs, requiring additional
  samples or kernel adjustments.
- **Artistic Control**: Highly flexible, with direction and strength parameters
  enabling unique effects.

### 6. Spectral Bloom

- **Description**: Simulates light dispersion into spectral colors, creating
  rainbow-like halos.
- **Visual Quality**: Exceptional for realism in scenarios like prisms or water
  droplets, though it may feel stylized.
- **Performance**: Computationally intensive due to per-channel processing and
  blending.
- **Artistic Control**: Rich parameterization (color spread, intensity) for
  tailored spectral effects.

### Critical Assessment

- **Visual Quality**: Gaussian blur excels in softness, Dual Kawase offers a
  balanced compromise, and anisotropic/spectral techniques provide unique
  aesthetics.
- **Performance**: Dual Kawase and pyramidal approaches lead in efficiency, with
  compute shaders shining at scale; Gaussian and spectral bloom are costlier.
- **Artistic Control**: Anisotropic and spectral bloom stand out for creative
  flexibility, while simpler methods rely on basic tweaks.

For our pipeline, we’ll combine a pyramidal approach with Dual Kawase blur for
efficiency and quality, optionally adding anisotropic or spectral components for
artistic flair.

## Aesthetic Goals

To emulate natural light interactions, we incorporate features that enhance
organic and refractive qualities:

- **Chromatic Aberration**: Simulates lens dispersion by slightly offsetting RGB
  channels, adding subtle color shifts to bloom edges.
- **Noise Injection**: Breaks up uniform halos with a noise texture, lending an
  organic texture to the glow.
- **Selective Color Manipulation**: Adjusts bloom color based on source
  luminance or hue (e.g., warm bloom for bright areas, cool for dim ones).
- **Anisotropic Filtering**: Applies directional blur to mimic light streaks,
  enhancing realism for dynamic sources.

These elements ensure the bloom feels alive and responsive to the scene’s
lighting context.

## Implementation Details

### Pipeline Overview

The bloom pipeline consists of multiple rendering passes:

1. **Threshold Pass**: Extracts bright areas above a luminance threshold.
2. **Downsample Passes**: Builds a pyramid of progressively smaller, blurred
   images.
3. **Upsample and Combine Passes**: Blends the pyramid levels back up, applying
   blur, and composites with the original image.
4. **Optional Effects**: Adds chromatic aberration, noise, or anisotropic
   filtering.

### WGSL Shader Snippets

#### Threshold Shader (Fragment)

Extracts bloom-contributing pixels:

```wgsl
[[group(0), binding(0)]] var t_input: texture_2d<f32>;
[[group(0), binding(1)]] var s_input: sampler;

struct Params {
    threshold: f32,
};
[[group(0), binding(2)]] var<uniform> params: Params;

[[stage(fragment)]]
fn threshold([[location(0)]] uv: vec2<f32>) -> [[location(0)]] vec4<f32> {
    let color = textureSample(t_input, s_input, uv);
    let luminance = dot(color.rgb, vec3<f32>(0.2126, 0.7152, 0.0722));
    if (luminance > params.threshold) {
        return color;
    }
    return vec4<f32>(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0);
}
```

#### Blur Shader (Dual Kawase, Fragment)

Applies a performant blur during downsampling/upsampling:

```wgsl
[[group(0), binding(0)]] var t_input: texture_2d<f32>;
[[group(0), binding(1)]] var s_input: sampler;

struct Params {
    texel_size: vec2<f32>,
};
[[group(0), binding(2)]] var<uniform> params: Params;

[[stage(fragment)]]
fn kawase_blur([[location(0)]] uv: vec2<f32>) -> [[location(0)]] vec4<f32> {
    let offset = params.texel_size * 1.5;
    var result = textureSample(t_input, s_input, uv) * 4.0;
    result += textureSample(t_input, s_input, uv + vec2<f32>(offset.x, offset.y));
    result += textureSample(t_input, s_input, uv + vec2<f32>(-offset.x, offset.y));
    result += textureSample(t_input, s_input, uv + vec2<f32>(offset.x, -offset.y));
    result += textureSample(t_input, s_input, uv + vec2<f32>(-offset.x, -offset.y));
    return result / 8.0;
}
```

#### Combine Shader (Fragment)

Blends bloom with the original image:

```wgsl
[[group(0), binding(0)]] var t_original: texture_2d<f32>;
[[group(0), binding(1)]] var t_bloom: texture_2d<f32>;
[[group(0), binding(2)]] var s: sampler;

struct Params {
    intensity: f32,
};
[[group(0), binding(3)]] var<uniform> params: Params;

[[stage(fragment)]]
fn combine([[location(0)]] uv: vec2<f32>) -> [[location(0)]] vec4<f32> {
    let original = textureSample(t_original, s, uv);
    let bloom = textureSample(t_bloom, s, uv);
    return original + bloom * params.intensity;
}
```

### Rust Structure

Using `wgpu` (a Rust WebGPU implementation), the pipeline is managed as follows:

```rust
use wgpu::{Device, Queue, Texture, RenderPipeline, BindGroup};

struct BloomPipeline {
    device: Device,
    queue: Queue,
    threshold_pipeline: RenderPipeline,
    blur_pipelines: Vec<RenderPipeline>, // For each pyramid level
    combine_pipeline: RenderPipeline,
    render_targets: Vec<Texture>, // Pyramid levels
    params_buffer: wgpu::Buffer,
}

impl BloomPipeline {
    fn new(device: &Device, queue: &Queue, config: &wgpu::SurfaceConfiguration) -> Self {
        // Create shaders, pipelines, and textures
        // Populate render_targets with downsampled sizes (e.g., 1/2, 1/4, 1/8 of original)
        // Initialize uniform buffers for parameters
        unimplemented!()
    }

    fn render(&self, source: &Texture, output: &wgpu::TextureView) {
        let mut encoder = self.device.create_command_encoder(&Default::default());

        // Threshold pass
        // Downsample and blur passes
        // Upsample and blur passes
        // Combine pass with optional effects

        self.queue.submit(std::iter::once(encoder.finish()));
    }
}
```

### Data Flow

- **Input**: HDR scene texture.
- **Threshold**: Outputs bright areas to the first render target.
- **Downsample**: Creates a pyramid (e.g., 4 levels), blurring each with Dual
  Kawase.
- **Upsample**: Combines levels upward, applying blur, into a final bloom
  texture.
- **Output**: Composites bloom with the original scene.

### Optimization Strategies

- **Render Target Compression**: Use `R11G11B10_FLOAT` for HDR data to save
  bandwidth.
- **Workgroup Size**: For compute shaders (optional), align with GPU wavefront
  size (e.g., 64 threads).
- **Filter Kernel**: Leverage separable filters or Dual Kawase’s efficiency to
  reduce samples.

---

## Artistic Control

Expose a parameter set for flexibility:

- **Threshold**: Luminance cutoff for bloom contribution (e.g., `0.8`).
- **Blur Radius**: Scales blur kernel size (e.g., `1.0` to `10.0`).
- **Intensity**: Bloom strength multiplier (e.g., `0.5` to `2.0`).
- **Color Tint**: RGB multiplier for bloom color (e.g., `vec3(1.0, 0.9, 0.8)`
  for warmth).
- **Chromatic Aberration Strength**: Offset magnitude (e.g., `0.005`).
- **Anisotropy**: Direction (angle) and strength for directional blur.

These parameters can be stored in a uniform buffer and updated dynamically.

## State-of-the-Art Exploration

### Research-Level Techniques

- **Physically-Based Bloom**: Simulates light scattering via ray marching; too
  costly for real-time but offers unparalleled realism.
- **ML-Based Bloom**: Uses neural networks trained on real-world bloom data;
  experimental and impractical for now.

### Combined Approach

Our pipeline uses:

- **Pyramidal Dual Kawase**: Core efficiency and quality.
- **Anisotropic Blur**: Optional directional effects.
- **Chromatic Aberration**: Realism via lens simulation.
- **HDR and Tone Mapping**: Processes bloom in HDR, applying tone mapping
  post-bloom to preserve dynamic range.

## Example Scenarios

1. **Moonlight on Foliage**:
   - Soft bloom with low intensity (`0.3`), cool tint (`vec3(0.8, 0.9, 1.0)`),
     and slight chromatic aberration (`0.002`).
2. **Neon Sign**:
   - Vibrant bloom with high intensity (`1.5`), spectral tint (e.g., red/green
     split), and anisotropic streaks (45° angle).
3. **Foggy Environment**:
   - Subtle bloom with noise injection (intensity `0.1`), low threshold (`0.5`),
     and diffuse blur radius (`5.0`).
4. **Bright Light Source (Sun/Explosion)**:
   - Intense bloom with high threshold (`1.0`), large radius (`8.0`), and
     spectral dispersion for a rainbow halo.

## Conclusion

This bloom rendering pipeline in Rust and WGSL combines efficient techniques
(Dual Kawase, pyramidal processing) with artistic enhancements (anisotropic
filtering, chromatic aberration) to deliver a visually stunning, flexible
effect. By leveraging HDR rendering and providing robust artistic controls, it
