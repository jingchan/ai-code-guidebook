## Technique Exploration

To build a sophisticated bloom pipeline, we first compare contemporary bloom
techniques, assessing their visual quality, performance, and artistic control.

### 1. Gaussian Blur

- **Description**: A traditional blur method using a Gaussian kernel to soften
  bright areas.
- **Strengths**: Produces a soft, high-quality bloom with smooth edges.
- **Weaknesses**: Computationally expensive at large radii due to many texture
  fetches, prone to uniform halos that can look artificial.
- **Visual Quality**: High, but lacks nuance without additional processing.
- **Performance**: Low; fill-rate intensive, especially at high resolutions.
- **Artistic Control**: Low; limited parameterization beyond radius and
  intensity.

### 2. Dual Kawase Blur

- **Description**: An optimized blur technique using a simplified kernel with
  fewer samples.
- **Strengths**: Fast and efficient for large blur radii, fewer artifacts than
  Gaussian.
- **Weaknesses**: Can produce boxy shapes at extreme settings.
- **Visual Quality**: Medium; softer than Gaussian but less customizable.
- **Performance**: High; fewer texture fetches improve efficiency.
- **Artistic Control**: Medium; good for subtle bloom but limited in
  stylization.

### 3. Multi-Scale Downsampling and Upsampling

- **Description**: A pyramidal approach that downsamples the image into mipmaps,
  blurs them, and upsamples back to full resolution.
- **Strengths**: Efficient for large bloom areas, leverages GPU mipmapping.
- **Weaknesses**: Risk of aliasing or blocky artifacts if not carefully
  filtered.
- **Visual Quality**: High; excels at soft, expansive blooms.
- **Performance**: High; reduces compute by working at lower resolutions.
- **Artistic Control**: High; flexible with blur radius and blending options.

### 4. Compute Shader-Based Tile Bloom

- **Description**: Uses compute shaders to process bloom in tiles, exploiting
  GPU parallelism.
- **Strengths**: Highly optimized for high resolutions, scalable performance.
- **Weaknesses**: Complex to implement, potential for tile boundary artifacts.
- **Visual Quality**: High; clean and precise with proper tuning.
- **Performance**: Very high; leverages modern GPU capabilities.
- **Artistic Control**: High; supports advanced effects with shader
  customization.

### 5. Anisotropic Bloom

- **Description**: Applies directional filtering to create light streaks.
- **Strengths**: Enhances realism and stylization with directional glow.
- **Weaknesses**: Increased complexity, potential for streaking artifacts.
- **Visual Quality**: High; unique and visually striking.
- **Performance**: Medium; depends on implementation complexity.
- **Artistic Control**: Very high; ideal for artistic directionality.

### 6. Spectral Bloom

- **Description**: Separates bloom into color channels to simulate dispersion.
- **Strengths**: Adds depth and vibrancy with color shifts.
- **Weaknesses**: Can appear unnatural if overdone, extra processing cost.
- **Visual Quality**: Very high; rich and refractive.
- **Performance**: Medium; requires additional channel computations.
- **Artistic Control**: Very high; excellent for vibrant, artistic effects.

## Aesthetic Goals

The pipeline aims to emulate the organic, refractive qualities of natural light
with:

- **Chromatic Aberration**: Subtle color shifts to mimic lens dispersion.
- **Noise Injection**: Breaks up uniform halos for a natural, textured glow.
- **Selective Color Manipulation**: Adjusts bloom based on luminance or spectral
  properties.
- **Anisotropic Filtering**: Adds directional streaks for stylistic flair.

These elements combine to create an ethereal, nuanced bloom that transcends
typical implementations.

## Implementation Details

### WGSL Code Snippets

#### Thresholding Pass (Fragment Shader)

Extracts bright areas based on luminance:

```wgsl
@fragment
fn threshold(@location(0) color: vec4<f32>, @builtin(position) pos: vec2<f32>) -> @location(0) vec4<f32> {
    let luminance = dot(color.rgb, vec3<f32>(0.2126, 0.7152, 0.0722));
    if (luminance > uniforms.threshold) {
        return color * (luminance - uniforms.threshold) / (1.0 - uniforms.threshold);
    }
    return vec4<f32>(0.0);
}
```

#### Dual Kawase Blur (Compute Shader - Downsample)

Efficiently blurs downsampled textures:

```wgsl
@compute @workgroup_size(8, 8)
fn downsample(@builtin(global_invocation_id) id: vec3<u32>) {
    let texel = vec2<f32>(id.xy);
    let sample = textureLoad(input_tex, texel, 0);
    let blur = (
        sample * 0.25 +
        textureLoad(input_tex, texel + vec2<f32>(1.0, 0.0), 0) * 0.125 +
        textureLoad(input_tex, texel + vec2<f32>(-1.0, 0.0), 0) * 0.125 +
        textureLoad(input_tex, texel + vec2<f32>(0.0, 1.0), 0) * 0.125 +
        textureLoad(input_tex, texel + vec2<f32>(0.0, -1.0), 0) * 0.125 +
        textureLoad(input_tex, texel + vec2<f32>(1.0, 1.0), 0) * 0.0625 +
        textureLoad(input_tex, texel + vec2<f32>(-1.0, -1.0), 0) * 0.0625 +
        textureLoad(input_tex, texel + vec2<f32>(1.0, -1.0), 0) * 0.0625 +
        textureLoad(input_tex, texel + vec2<f32>(-1.0, 1.0), 0) * 0.0625
    );
    textureStore(output_tex, texel / 2.0, blur);
}
```

#### Chromatic Aberration and Composite (Fragment Shader)

Combines bloom with aberration and noise:

```wgsl
@fragment
fn composite(@location(0) uv: vec2<f32>) -> @location(0) vec4<f32> {
    let base = textureSample(base_tex, sampler, uv);
    let r = textureSample(bloom_tex, sampler, uv + vec2<f32>(uniforms.aberration_strength, 0.0)).r;
    let g = textureSample(bloom_tex, sampler, uv).g;
    let b = textureSample(bloom_tex, sampler, uv - vec2<f32>(uniforms.aberration_strength, 0.0)).b;
    let bloom = vec4<f32>(r, g, b, 1.0) * uniforms.bloom_intensity;
    let noise = textureSample(noise_tex, sampler, uv * uniforms.noise_scale).r * uniforms.noise_strength;
    return base + bloom * (1.0 + noise);
}
```

### Rust Structure

Manages the pipeline and resources:

```rust
struct BloomPipeline {
    device: wgpu::Device,
    queue: wgpu::Queue,
    threshold_pass: wgpu::RenderPipeline,
    downsample_pass: wgpu::ComputePipeline,
    upsample_pass: wgpu::ComputePipeline,
    composite_pass: wgpu::RenderPipeline,
    bloom_texture: wgpu::Texture,
    bloom_sampler: wgpu::Sampler,
    mip_levels: u32,
    uniforms: wgpu::Buffer,
}

impl BloomPipeline {
    fn new(device: &wgpu::Device, queue: &wgpu::Queue, format: wgpu::TextureFormat, width: u32, height: u32) -> Self {
        // Initialize shaders, textures, and buffers...
        unimplemented!()
    }

    fn render(&self, encoder: &mut wgpu::CommandEncoder, source: &wgpu::TextureView, target: &wgpu::TextureView) {
        // Execute pipeline passes...
        unimplemented!()
    }
}
```

### Data Flow

1. **Thresholding**: Render bright areas to a texture using luminance
   thresholding.
2. **Multi-Scale Downsampling**: Create a mipmap chain with compute shaders and
   Dual Kawase blur.
3. **Upsampling**: Blend upsampled textures with anisotropic filtering if
   enabled.
4. **Composite**: Combine with the original image, applying chromatic aberration
   and noise.

### Optimization Strategies

- **Render Target Compression**: Use half-resolution bloom textures to reduce
  memory bandwidth.
- **Workgroup Size**: Set to 8x8 or 16x16 for compute shaders, balancing
  occupancy and latency.
- **Filter Kernel**: Leverage Dual Kawase for fewer texture fetches compared to
  Gaussian.

## Artistic Control

The pipeline offers a flexible parameter set:

- **Thresholding**: Adjustable luminance threshold and color-based weighting.
- **Blur Radius**: Controls bloom intensity and spread.
- **Color Tinting**: Applies tint to bloom for stylistic effects.
- **Chromatic Aberration Strength**: Tunes dispersion intensity.
- **Anisotropy**: Direction and strength for light streaks.

These parameters are exposed via a uniform buffer:

```wgsl
struct Uniforms {
    threshold: f32,
    bloom_intensity: f32,
    blur_radius: f32,
    aberration_strength: f32,
    noise_strength: f32,
    noise_scale: f32,
    anisotropy_direction: vec2<f32>,
    anisotropy_strength: f32,
}
```

## State-of-the-Art Exploration

### Research-Level Techniques

- **Spectral Bloom with Wavelength Dispersion**: Simulates light dispersion by
  wavelength, though computationally intensive. Could be approximated with
  per-channel processing.
- **Combination**: Multi-scale downsampling with Dual Kawase blur provides
  efficiency, enhanced by anisotropic filtering for style and spectral bloom for
  vibrancy. Noise injection adds naturalism.

### HDR and Tone Mapping

- **HDR Rendering**: Preserves bloom subtlety by maintaining high dynamic range.
- **Tone Mapping**: Applies Reinhard tone mapping (`color / (color + 1.0)`) to
  balance exposure, ensuring bloom integrates naturally with the scene.

## Example Scenarios

1. **Moonlight Glow**:
   - Low threshold, high blur radius, subtle blue tint, noise injection for soft
     foliage glow.
2. **Neon Sign**:
   - High threshold, moderate blur, strong chromatic aberration, spectral bloom
     for vibrant color shifts.
3. **Foggy Environment**:
   - Medium threshold, large blur radius, noise injection for atmospheric depth.
4. **Bright Light Source (e.g., Sun or Explosion)**:
   - High threshold, intense anisotropic bloom with directional streaks, HDR for
     dynamic range.

blur, compute shader optimization, and artistic enhancements like chromatic
aberration, noise injection, and anisotropic filtering. Implemented in Rust and
WGSL, it delivers a performant, visually stunning effect with extensive artistic
control, making it ideal for indie games or applications seeking to capture the
ethereal beauty of natural luminescence. By leveraging HDR and state-of-the-art
