High-Quality, Physically-Based Chromatic Aberration Shader (WGSL)

This shader accurately simulates chromatic aberration using a thin lens model,
incorporating:

1. Wavelength-dependent refraction for per-channel distortion.
2. Radial chromatic aberration that scales with field-of-view.
3. Longitudinal chromatic aberration causing depth-dependent focus shifts.
4. Lens distortion (barrel distortion for more accurate fringing).
5. Adjustable parameters for fine control over aberration intensity.
6. Sample Across a Spectrum: Instead of shifting only three discrete wavelengths
   (R, G, B), sample multiple points across a wavelength spectrum (e.g.,
   400nm–700nm).
7. Use a Weighted Integral: Blend multiple spectral samples based on the human
   perception response (CIE color matching functions).
8. Fourier Optics Approximation: Approximate the lens’ true dispersion curve
   using a polynomial function rather than linear shifts.
9. Gaussian Blur Approximation: Simulate real-world dispersion by blurring edges
   more strongly for shorter wavelengths (blue shifts more than red).
10. Use Full Optical Dispersion Model • Real-world chromatic aberration is based
    on Sellmeier’s equation or Cauchy’s equation, which models how different
    wavelengths bend at different angles. • Instead of a linear or polynomial
    shift, we apply physically based dispersion curves.

11. Account for Asymmetrical and Tangential Aberration • In real lenses,
    chromatic aberration isn’t just radial; different parts of the lens distort
    colors in different ways. • Implement tangential and sagittal shifts
    separately.

12. Simulate Higher-Order Aberrations • Spherical aberration, coma, and
    astigmatism interact with chromatic aberration. • This means aberration
    should increase non-linearly with distance from the optical center.

13. More Spectral Samples for Smoother Wavelength Interpolation • Instead of 8
    spectral samples, increase to 16 or more. • Use the CIE 1931 color matching
    functions to weight each wavelength correctly.

14. Apply Wave Optics Instead of Geometric Optics • Instead of just shifting
    colors, use wave interference and diffraction models to approximate real
    dispersion.

# how could this shader be improved further and give much more accurate and lifelike representation of chromatic aberration?

The above shows some scattered notes and and simple toy examples of the
Chromatic Aberration Effect. However, those are much too simple for our use
case. We are interested in something that is more grounded in physically
accurate modelling of the effect, using observations from optics and the study
of lenses.

Please consider how these forms could be improved in terms of accuracy and
realism in creating a realistic and life-like chromatic aberration effect. We
are interested only in state-of-the-art techniques and would want to explore the
limits of how accurately chromatic aberration can be modelled utilizing GPU
accelerated hardware. We are looking for highly accurate and highly detailed
chromatic aberration that matches the real world as much as possible, we do not
necessarily require something that can run in real-time that would or could need
to be used in real time.

The result should be code written with rust and wgsl and wgpu. IT should far
exceed the quality of the simple examples provided above, which are rough
approximations of the effect provided simply for reference purposes, but should
not be used for the resultant code, primarily because it is of limited accuracy,
precision, and reflection of real world chromatic aberattion.

Consider fully the physics and math behind the effect, and consider deeply what
ways we can push the limits of Chromatic Aberration rendering. could you show me
a much more sophisticated, world class, state of the art chromatic aberration
shader code?
