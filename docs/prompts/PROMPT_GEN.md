## Asking for a detailed plan for a software project for a solo developer.

> Propose a lengthy and detailed prompt that asks for detailed and comprehensive
> plan on how to make a video game using wgpu and winit libraries. It already
> has the starting structure, with basic rendering, with usage of compute shader
> and the vertex, fragment shaders, windowing, and game loop, but is still in
> the early stages.
>
> The plan be suitable for a solo developer aiming to iterate quickly and have
> presentable results at regular milestones to keep motivation high. Feel free
> to suggest placeholder assets or smaller implementations of various functions
> to hold over until a later point in the project when it becomes more important
> to build it out.
>
> Please be detailed in the request, and suggest creative ways that can produces
> high impact for relatively low amounts of effort. Please consider what I might
> also be missing in this request and amend those as well to the prompt.

## Asking for guidance on dealing with information overload when building software.

> Please help me figure out a good lengthy and detailed prompt to ask for help
> about when feeling lost with all the decisions about architecture in a game
> engine or perhaps any software project. E.g. What knowledge would I need to
> overcome this issue or is it more of a constant state that you have to deal
> with when building software? Please consider what other helpful additions
> would be useful to this question and provide a prompt that comphrensively asks
> to summarize a conclusive response covering all such topics.

## Asking for a prompt to sound as an experienced professional would ask.

> Please suggest an improved version of the following prompt and make it more
> precise and clear, also find examples and specifics that would be especially
> nice to add in that would maximize the chances of getting a great answer.
> Please act as an extremely experienced professional graphics programmer and
> digital artist and use the approrpiate terminology and lingo that would be
> seen in the highest tiers of that profession:
>
> how to make an especially impressive looking skybox WGSL, one that captures
> the wonderous nature of the sky and can transition between day and night cycle
> based on time uniform. Please consider all options and describe the most
> impressive solution with the best aesthetic quality.

### Act like a seasoned developer and ask for a piece of software.

> I want help writing a prompt that will ask for a piece of software. The
> software should be a Command line tool written in rust. It should be able to
> take an entire git project and convert it into a single long text file. That
> text file should describe the folder structure and preserve the filename. The
> program should be complete and error free. Give me a thoroughly worded
> question that will ask for this. Please take on the role of a highly
> experienced and beyond world-class seasoned developer, and describe it with
> the same tonality and terminology that you would expect from the highest
> echelons of professionals in the software and programming space.

Notes: Not that good, as expected, Kinda snotty
