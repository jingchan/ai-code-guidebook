Below is a compact, concise checklist for developing a basic first game level,
broken into small, actionable 1-2 hour tasks. Use this as a TODO list—check off
items as you complete them to track your progress!

## Game Level Development Checklist

### Currently Doing

- [ ] Place 3-5 static objects (rocks, trees)
- [ ] Add basic water (flat plane with texture)

### To Do Later

##### Game World

- [ ] Create a flat terrain (plane/grid)
- [ ] Add a simple skybox or gradient
- [ ] Set up level boundaries (invisible walls)

##### Player Character

- [ ] Build a basic player shape (cube/capsule)
- [ ] Implement jumping (spacebar)
- [ ] Add a basic animation (e.g., walk cycle)
- [ ] Set up player spawn point

##### Controls

- [ ] Map movement keys (WASD)
- [ ] Add mouse look (camera rotation)
- [ ] Enable sprint (Shift key)
- [ ] Bind an action key (e.g., E for interact)
- [ ] Add crouch functionality (Ctrl key)

##### Camera System

- [ ] Set up a third-person follow camera
- [ ] Add basic camera collision
- [ ] Enable zoom (mouse wheel)
- [ ] Smooth camera movement
- [ ] Add a first-person toggle option

##### Physics

- [ ] Apply gravity to player
- [ ] Add ground detection for jumping
- [ ] Enable pushing small objects
- [ ] Set up a slippery surface
- [ ] Add a bouncy object

##### Collision Detection

- [ ] Create player collision box
- [ ] Set terrain collision
- [ ] Add collision to static objects
- [ ] Implement wall collision
- [ ] Test edge cases (corners, slopes)

##### AI and NPCs

- [ ] Place a static NPC
- [ ] Add NPC patrol (two points)
- [ ] Enable basic interaction (e.g., "Hello!")
- [ ] Add a chase behavior
- [ ] Create a simple NPC animation

##### User Interface (UI)

- [ ] Add a health bar
- [ ] Display a score counter
- [ ] Build a pause menu
- [ ] Add a basic HUD (ammo/time)
- [ ] Create a main menu screen

##### Audio

- [ ] Implement background music loop
- [ ] Add footstep sounds
- [ ] Include jump sound effect
- [ ] Add interaction sound (e.g., click)
- [ ] Set up ambient noise (wind, birds)

##### Lighting

- [ ] Add a directional light (sun)
- [ ] Set up ambient lighting
- [ ] Place a point light (e.g., torch)
- [ ] Add shadows to key objects
- [ ] Test night mode lighting

##### Level Design

- [ ] Design a start-to-end path
- [ ] Add 2-3 obstacles (walls, gaps)
- [ ] Create a simple puzzle (e.g., lever)
- [ ] Place a collectible item
- [ ] Add a hidden area

##### Story and Objectives

- [ ] Define a level goal (e.g., reach exit)
- [ ] Add a start screen with text
- [ ] Set up a win condition
- [ ] Include a failure state (e.g., death)
- [ ] Add a short intro cutscene

##### Performance Optimization

- [ ] Enable frustum culling
- [ ] Batch static objects
- [ ] Test frame rate
- [ ] Reduce texture sizes
- [ ] Profile CPU usage

##### Testing and Debugging

- [ ] Playtest level start to finish
- [ ] Fix movement bugs
- [ ] Resolve collision issues
- [ ] Test with a friend
- [ ] Polish one feature (e.g., jumping)

### Completed Tasks

- [ ] Add WASD movement

### Notes

- **Keep it Simple**: Start with placeholders (e.g., cubes) and refine later.
- **Stay on Track**: Each task is 1-2 hours—split bigger ones if needed.
- **Next Steps**: After finishing, add complexity (e.g., more NPCs, puzzles).

Let me know if you need more tasks or tweaks!
