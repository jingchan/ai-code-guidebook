# AI Coding Best Practices: A Comprehensive Guide

As AI coding assistants become increasingly sophisticated, it's crucial to develop good practices for working with them effectively. This guide covers essential best practices to help you maximize the benefits while avoiding common pitfalls.

## Core Principles

### 1. Verify and Validate

Always review AI-generated code before implementing it:

```rust
// ❌ Don't blindly accept AI suggestions
let unsafe_code = ai.generate_code();
use_in_production(unsafe_code);  // Risky!

// ✅ Review and validate first
let generated_code = ai.generate_code();
if validate_code(&generated_code) {
    run_tests(&generated_code);
    code_review(&generated_code);
    use_in_production(generated_code);
}
```

### 2. Maintain Context

Provide clear context for better results:

```rust
// ❌ Poor context
ai.generate("add authentication");

// ✅ Clear context
ai.generate("""
Add JWT authentication with the following requirements:
- Use RS256 algorithm
- 15-minute token expiration
- Include user roles in claims
- Implement refresh token mechanism
""");
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Never share sensitive data**

   - API keys
   - Passwords
   - Personal information
   - Internal business logic

2. **Validate security-critical code**
   - Authentication
   - Authorization
   - Data validation
   - Cryptographic operations

## Code Quality

Maintain high standards:

```rust
// ❌ Accepting unclear code
fn process(x: i32) -> i32 {
    let a = x * 2;
    let b = a + 3;
    b - 1
}

// ✅ Requesting clear, documented code
/// Processes a number through a specific algorithm
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `input` - The number to process
///
/// # Returns
/// The processed result: (input * 2 + 3) - 1
fn process_number(input: i32) -> i32 {
    let doubled = input * 2;
    let added = doubled + 3;
    added - 1
}
```

## Workflow Integration

### Version Control

```bash
# Create feature branch for AI-assisted work
git checkout -b feature/ai-assisted-auth

# Commit with clear messages
git commit -m "Add JWT authentication
- Implemented using AI assistance
- Manually reviewed and tested
- Added unit tests"
```

### Documentation

Always document AI usage:

```rust
//! This module was developed with AI assistance
//! AI was used for:
//! - Initial code structure
//! - Test case generation
//! - Documentation templates
//!
//! All code has been reviewed and tested by human developers.
```

## Testing Strategy

Implement comprehensive testing:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_ai_generated_function() {
        // Arrange
        let input = 42;

        // Act
        let result = process_number(input);

        // Assert
        assert_eq!(result, 86); // (42 * 2 + 3) - 1
    }

    // Add edge cases
    #[test]
    fn test_edge_cases() {
        assert_eq!(process_number(0), 2);
        assert_eq!(process_number(-1), 1);
        assert_eq!(process_number(i32::MAX), i32::MAX * 2 + 2);
    }
}
```

## Continuous Learning

1. **Keep track of successful patterns**

   - Document what works well
   - Share with team members
   - Create reusable templates

2. **Learn from mistakes**
   - Record common issues
   - Develop prevention strategies
   - Update team guidelines

## Conclusion

Working effectively with AI coding assistants requires a balanced approach:

- Trust but verify
- Maintain high standards
- Focus on security
- Document extensively
- Test thoroughly

Remember: AI is a powerful tool, but it's your expertise that makes it truly effective.
