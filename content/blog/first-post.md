# Getting Started with AI-Assisted Coding

Artificial intelligence is transforming how developers write code. From
intelligent code completion to automated refactoring, AI tools are becoming an
essential part of the modern developer's toolkit.

## Benefits of AI-Assisted Coding

- **Increased productivity**: AI can help you write code faster by suggesting
  completions and generating boilerplate code.
- **Reduced errors**: AI can catch potential bugs and suggest fixes before you
  even run your code.
- **Learning new languages**: AI can help you learn new programming languages by
  providing context-aware suggestions.

## Popular AI Coding Tools

Here are some popular AI-assisted coding tools that you might want to try:

1. **GitHub Copilot**: An AI pair programmer that suggests code completions
   based on context.
2. **Tabnine**: An AI code completion tool that works with multiple languages
   and IDEs.
3. **Kite**: An AI coding assistant that provides intelligent code completions.

```python
# Example of AI-assisted coding
def calculate_fibonacci(n):
    """
    Calculate the nth Fibonacci number.

    Args:
        n: The position in the Fibonacci sequence

    Returns:
        The nth Fibonacci number
    """
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return calculate_fibonacci(n-1) + calculate_fibonacci(n-2)
```

## Getting Started

To get started with AI-assisted coding, choose a tool that integrates with your
preferred IDE and programming languages. Most tools offer free tiers that allow
you to experience the benefits before committing to a paid plan.

Remember that AI tools are meant to assist, not replace, human developers. They
work best when used as part of a thoughtful development process that includes
planning, testing, and code review.
